# Vaccination_Scenarios
Program in Matlab associated with the generation of vaccination scenarios against COVID-19.


There are three folders: Chicago, NYC (New York City) and Buenos Aires.

In each folder we have two programs; one that considers the age range of the population and another in which it is not considered.
