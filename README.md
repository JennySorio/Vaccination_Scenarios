## Repository contents

There are two folders: Chicago and NYC (New York City). The programs present in each one are very similar. The main differences are related to the data format of each one.

FECHAS DE LOS DATOS.

In each folder we have two types of programs; one that considers the age range of the population and another in which it is not considered.
